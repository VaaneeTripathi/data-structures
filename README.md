# Data Structures and Algorithms - A Little For A Lot

Welcome to the Data Structures and Algorithms repository, this could be your first introduction to the monstrosity of what is to come or just something you are chancing on along the way. Regardless, I worked on this repository after my DSA course in an attempt to collate things that every DSA course ever covers - just the general stuff. So here is my little to help you with the lot. All the best!
